PG FINDER
A Local Hostel Search Platform
Problem Statement
Users moving to new cities for education or work often struggle to find suitable accommodations due to various challenges. The key issues include:
➢
Lack of Centralized Information: Users often rely on informal networks or outdated sources to search for PG accommodations, leading to limited and unreliable options.
➢
Unverified Listings: There is no system in place to validate the quality, amenities, or authenticity of PG accommodations, resulting in potential safety and quality concerns.
➢
Manual Processes: Property owners still use manual methods to advertise and manage their PGs, which are inefficient and lack reach.
➢
No Real-Time Updates: Users face difficulties in knowing whether their preferred PG options are available or booked, causing delays in decision-making.
